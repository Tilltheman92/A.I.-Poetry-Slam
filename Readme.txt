For my final project of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp I decided on a more creative approach, since my former Employer would not supply me with the expected data.
So I decided to dig into NLP and more specific Text Generation.
Since most of the research in this field is done in English I decided to switch to German (my mother tongue).
I decided to use all availaable text of Goethe (agruably the most famous German poet) as my input and tried to generate German poetry.
I first used only his poems (over 300, more than 500.000 characters) but after adding other works to the input (in total over 2.000.000 characters) the results improved a lot.
While proceeding I found different approaches to generating text and decided to use 4 differnt Neural Networks to create poetry.
To present my project I created an A.I. Poetry Slam between the generated poems and an actual Goethe poem.
In the first presentation (to a non-german crowd) a created poem won.
